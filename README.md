##### Project Description:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### This project centers in the offline functionality of a banking tracking application. The existing app, namely "Budget Tracker", lacks such capability and expects one to fix it using browser's storage mechanism IndexDB as well as service worker for cache data that makes offline loading possible, i.e. at the very least, the basic resources are render properly so that end-users can access and submit data entry. The bank balance should be caculated and reflected on the web page once the internet regained, i.e. Network is 'online' which in Chrome has the equivalent preset of "Fast 3G". Budget Tracker is also leveraged with a web manifest to become a Progressive Web Application where one can downloaded and install it on mobile devices.
